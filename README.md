### Facemash - Backedn

Here is my backend where i cover all possible useCases and apply clean architecture to make it the most original possible. As like in the movie i'm using the same simple UI, but also an original aspect.

Ps. I have not applied TDD here, small commits, but i applied good patters as like decorators, factories, repositories etc... also i'm trying my best to organize eveything without running agains S.O.L.I.D principles.
